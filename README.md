# arm-dro
ARM based dro

This repository has design files for the cheap DRO I made for my mini mill and lathe

It's all untidy, this is really just a dump for the code and PCB files, but if you want to have a go at making one then there's enough here to give you a good start.

Hopefully it all compiles and builds, and the PCBs are fine, but if there's problems then let me know, or fix them...
